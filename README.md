#Zafran
Zafran is a game engine that aims to be the unique from the group,
it has no features planned yet, but its in development, the features are gonna be determined after a significat chunk of the Zafran Renderer will be built
and its only avalible for linux for the moment by default
im sure you can mess with premake and a little bit of the code to make it work tho

#Building
To build Zafran , you need to use premake5 with whatever configuration that suits your system
I included the Makefiles just in case you dont have premake 
and this project dosent contain submodules which can be a headache when working with frequently updating dependences
instead the dependences are included with the project

Thanks For Reading
